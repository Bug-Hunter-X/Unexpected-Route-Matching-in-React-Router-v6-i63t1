# Unexpected Route Matching in React Router v6

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router v6 concerning route matching.  The issue is related to how routes are interpreted and matched based on the URL, leading to either incorrect component rendering or blank pages unexpectedly.

## Problem Description

The main `App` component uses `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route` to define the application's routing. However, under certain conditions (e.g., specific URL structures or nested routes), the route matching fails to work as intended.

## Solution

The solution involves careful review of the route paths, ensuring they are correctly defined, and possibly the implementation of nested routes with `useLocation` to precisely control rendering based on the complete route.  Also, potential issues in `App` component structure should be verified.
